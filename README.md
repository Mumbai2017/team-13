## MAKE A WISH

-------

## Mission:

-------

We exist for one reason – to grant magical wishes to enrich the lives of children and young people fighting life-threatening conditions. Because a child’s life shouldn’t be about illness, hospitals and diagnosis – it should be about wonder, joy and hope. We go above and beyond to grant very special wishes to very special children; their dreams made a reality at a time when they need it most. We’ve seen the effects a wish can have on a seriously ill child: from providing respite from the daily struggles that come with a life-threatening condition to building confidence, bringing happiness and creating incredible memories. We know what wishes can give, and this is the driving force behind why we continue to do what we do.

 

## Context: 

-------

Make-A-Wish India has a wish granting process which is a continuous exercise for the foundation in all the 10 divisions. The process is carried out through a large team of volunteers at these centers. The process involves the following steps:

### Step 1: Treating hospital refers a Child (contingent on meeting eligibility criteria)

### Step 2: Volunteers meet the child and the parents

### Step 3: Volunteers record the Wishes (Total of 3 wishes, in order of priority)

### Step 4: Divisional office triggers Wish Fulfillment Process

### Step 5: Divisional office organizes Wish Granting Function at the appointed date & time

### Step 6: Divisional office records the Wish Experience and shares the same with the donors

 

At any point they have 800-1,000 wishes pending to be granted. This is pending due to given reasons.

Manual forms to manage the volunteer, donor and wishes
Lack of funds
Processing delays such as Cross checking if wish has been granted in past due to manual nature of search
 

## Challenge Statement: 

-------

Make A Wish India needs a mobile app to streamline their Wish Identification & Wish Granting process. The app will be used by their divisional office staff for wish processing as well as by the volunteers who visit the hospitals to record the wishes.

The app should extensively be able to streamline the co-ordination between the volunteers and the staff to avoid any processing delays and have the following features at the minimum:

## Volunteers should be able to:

-------

Record the wish directly on the app which should cross check automatically if the wish has been granted in the past and immediately notify the same to the volunteer
On submitting the wish, the app should be able to automatically
categorize the wish (“to have…/ to go…/ to meet…/ to be…”) basis the wish text and the past wish data
match the new wish with the past wishes of the same type
devise an action plan for the wish fulfillment if an exact or similar match has been found in the past
notify the divisional office the wish, wish type & action plan (if available)
Record the wish experience during the wish granting event
Division office staff should be able to:

Manage all of the volunteer, donor and wish data
Use the app for managing/ tracking the progress of the wish granting process.
Be notified about a new wish along with the wish categorized into “to have…/ to go…/ to meet…/ to be…” and its action plan (if available) to speed up the wish fulfillment process
Reach out to registered donors for funds
Donors should be able to:

Complete the self-registration for themselves using the app
 

## Additional Considerations: 

-------

Track the wish processing through the app.
How can this technology solution help attract donors?
Think of yourself as a Donor and a user of this app. What features would you like to add in the portal to make a real impact?
Wouldn’t it be impactful to have a feature to track the wishes you have sponsored?
Offer a mechanism to Auto-email the donors with the wish fulfillment details along with the wish experience whenever a wish is closed.
Think about adding a feature to have SMS/Call based alerting for the Donors.
 

## Technology Baseline: 

-------

Currently Make A Wish India does not have any technology setup to support the wish granting process.
